# My-portfolio-website

That is my portfolio website. I created in 2020 after four years of developing skills in the web development field. This website will be an example of my work and skills,  and I want to be stylish and simple for the recruiters. 

In the beginning, I started with a design that I changed a little bit through the working process. However, I tried to stick to conception and not make significant changes. 

# The design

I created the UI design on my own using Canva. Although I know how to use PhotoShop I found it much easier and faster to create the design with it instead of PhotoShop. My personal opinion is that nowadays we have to use much more simple and user-friendly technologies which can give us pretty the same result instead of wasting our time in complicated software. However, this all depends on the needs of the purpose and in some situations, we can NOT do our job professional without all these super software as PhotoShop is. 

# Features

My goal is to continue developing my portfolio website and for this purpose, I want to separate the sections into multiple files and using PHP to combine them. That will allow me to change the design or even to change the position of the section with moving just one line of code. 

More I want to build an administrator dashboard and make my CV available for download on request.

Although there are loads of things I can add to my portfolio website to be more efficient, I want to keep it simple for all users.
